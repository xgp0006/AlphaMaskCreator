# AlphaMaskCreator

 Create alpha masks and textures for terrain stamps from inside Unity.

### Description

This tool uses an orthographic camera to create a height map. The height map can be used for alpha masks or for terrain stamps. Basically you could create a terrain with various terrain stamps and create another terrain stamp from it. Or you could just create alpha masks from gameobjects and use those masks in other applications like e. g. Substance Painter.
